Please contact the DBI website analyst at webteam@dbi.vic.gov.au if you need assistance with implementing or customising this code.

For example, the DBI website analyst can assist with customisations to:
~ report on the number of results on a search results page
~ send back a custom value in the trackPageview field, such as the breadcrumb trail or a metadata value, instead of the URL
~ define subdomains or subfolders as external referring sites (for the traffic source reports) and/or outbound sites (for outbound tracking reports)
~ and much more...

IMPORTANT: In order to track websites properly, all websites must have their own profile number.
